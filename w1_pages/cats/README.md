Part 5:

On the canvas, there are 20 generated cat faces. I try to show as many difference of cats as I can. There are 10 variability in it. I added a wood shelf outside the arrangment. I was trying to add some rectangle behind the cats to create a fake 3D effect. However it doesn't look good enough. So I keep a simple wooden style color as the background. I also try to add two red lanterns on left hand and right hand side (cute Japanese cartoon style), but as soon as I add the lanterns on the canvas, I found that could be too many elements on canvas. If I have more time, I really want to find out how to wave the head of the cat. The 'swing' animation could be fun.
