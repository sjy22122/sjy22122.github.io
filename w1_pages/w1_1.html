						<h4>AR Hybrid Gift - An Android application.
							<h5>This project is sought to explore the implementation of “game-like” AR technology in hybrid gifts, which enhances the user experience and engagement of hybrid gifts, as well as creating hybrid gifts that are valued by receivers.</h5>
							Project demo available at: <a href="https://vimeo.com/864371345?share=copy">https://vimeo.com/864371345?share=copy</a>

								<p>The project is going to explore a novel form of hybrid gift which allows givers to create customized AR experiences for receivers.
									 Givers are able to upload their digital content and to create a customized drink for the receivers. 
									 Gift receivers may interact with and receive the hybrid gift in the “Receiver Page”. 
									 A double-side card comes with the gift box. One side of the card has a tracker image, and another side of the card has a QR code and some instructions for logging in to the service. 
									 After logging in, the receiver can then use the tracker image for receiving gifts. 
								</p>
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="w1_1_02.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>After scanning the tracker image, a bar and a bartender show up. The receivers are able to receive messages and the customized drink from the giver through the bartender. 
									There are two methods for receiving the customized drink. 
									The first way is the receivers can let the bartender to make that drink for them. 
									This is a general approach for AR interaction, users can interact with the virtual content by clicking on the screen. 
									Another method is a “game-like” interaction which allows users to make the customized drink by themselves. 
								</p>
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="w1_1_03.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>Users are required to manipulate the bottles from the gift box to pour the virtual liquids into the virtual glass. 
									This approach allows users to use physical objects for interacting and to change the virtual content on their wishes.</p>
